## üí° Getting Started

First, install Answers-core via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm):

```bash
npm install @yext/answers-core
```

Then, initialize the core library in your application.

```js
import { provideCore } from '@yext/answers-core';
const core = provideCore({
  apiKey: '<your api key>',
  experienceKey: '<one of your experience keys>',
  locale: 'en',
  experienceVersion: 'PRODUCTION',
});
```

Finally, let's run a search on an "FAQs" vertical.

```js
core.verticalSearch({
  verticalKey: 'FAQs',
  query: 'What is Yext Answers?',
}).then(results => {
  // Do something with the search results
});
```

See **[our documentation](docs/answers-core.answerscore.md)** for a full list of supported API calls.
